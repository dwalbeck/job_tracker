    - KEYWORDS that are technologies should not be placed where they clash with other incompatible technologies mentioned
    - Use each of the given KEYWORDS at least once within the resume where they naturally fit
    - FOCUS keyword list should have each entry used 2-3 times within the resume
    
2. **Job Position Title**:
    - The same job position title used in the job description, should be used as the job title in the resume
    - Use the "RESUME JOB TITLE" and "RESUME JOB TITLE LINE #" values (if set) to correctly identify and replace with "JOB TITLE" value
    - Keep any formatting designation for the job title
    - If the JOB TITLE includes text contained with parenthesis, then do not use or include the parenthesis or text contained within
