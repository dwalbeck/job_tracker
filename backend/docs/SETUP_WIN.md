### Configure Docker Desktop

You will need to change one of the default settings in order for Docker Desktop to be able to handle 
the network connections.  Click on the gear icon in the top right corner of Docker Desktop to open the 
settings menu. Then click on "Resources" in the left sidebar, and then click on "Network".  You'll see 
a checkbox next to "Enable host networking", you will want to insure that this is checked to enable 
this feature. The "Default networking mode" can be set to either "IPv4 only" or "Dual IPv4/IPv6" and 
keep the "Inhibit DNS resolution for IPv4 / IPv6" at it's default setting of "Auto".
